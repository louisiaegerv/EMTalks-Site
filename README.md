# EMTalks-Site
The replacement for ExxonMobil's annual TEDx event, EMTalks is an event which brings speakers from all over the company to provide inspirational talks about their experiences and stories.   Technology: I helped create and design this using AngularJS and ExxonMobil's CSS Framework, Elements.   Site was used to nominate speakers, allow attendees to register for multiple sessions, view info about the speakers, watch last years TEDxEM event videos, and to get more information about the event.
