# EMTalks-Site
The replacement for ExxonMobil's annual TEDx event, EMTalks is an event which brings speakers from all over the company to provide inspirational talks about their experiences and stories.   

Technology: 
------
I helped create and design this using AngularJS and ExxonMobil's CSS Framework, *Elements*.   


The site was used to:
* Nominate speakers
* Allow attendees to register for multiple sessions
* View info about the speakers
* Watch last years TEDxEM event videos
* Get more information about the event
